Developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow to classify network packets from the UNSW-NB15
dataset, focusing on distinguishing between normal and 10 different types of malicious network traffic.
• Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering using Pandas and Numpy, including encoding categorical features
and expanding the dataset to 196 features for model training.
• Trained and optimized the DNN model, achieving effective classification results, leveraging a technical stack that includes
TensorFlow, Pandas, and Numpy.
